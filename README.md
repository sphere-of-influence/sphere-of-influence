Sharing the stories of Soviet Citizens and insights into daily life within the Soviet Union, Sphere of Influence aims to cast the USSR in a positive light and share its culture with a modern audience. The project hopes to shatter illusions that the [current state of society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism) is a fixed absolute, by offering a window through which to admire an alternative model.

Sphere of Influence is built and maintained by volunteers in their spare time, it is a project of love. Current editors are [@sovietarchitect](//twitter.com/sovietarchitect) and [Bogstandard](//github.com/bogstandard), with assistance of family and friends.

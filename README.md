Sharing the stories of Soviet Citizens and insights into daily life within the Soviet Union, Sphere of Influence aims to cast the USSR in a positive light and share its culture with a modern audience.

Sphere of Influence is built and maintained by volunteers in their spare time. Current editors are [@sovietarchitect](//twitter.com/sovietarchitect) and [Bogstandard](//github.com/bogstandard), with assistance of family and friends.



## Why the USSR?
The USSR presents a unique study, a vast state encompassing many nations in one of the most culture rich periods of history. It also no longer exists.
Twitter has many dedicated accounts regularly posting snapshots of daily life from within its borders, these provide a rich steady source of content for the project and because the USSR is (in terms of man's history) relatively recent the geography hasn't changed much beyond renamings (and a [lost sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea)!). This makes for relatively accurate best-guess geotagging.

###### A Positive Outlook?
The project employs a self-aware air of positivity towards the USSR as a [stylistic choice](https://sphere-of-influence.github.io//pages/contributing.html), the focus is on life within a now vanished-state & not so much the broader history. 

Occasionally the *On This Day* feature will display the darker side of the USSR.

## As a Content Mapping Platform
The Sphere of Influence is a demo of the engine which runs it, a tool for automated geo-mapping of twitter content from select accounts, flexible with plugins but robust and simple in presentation.
